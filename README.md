### What is _eyes_?
_eyes_ is complete Golang rewrite of the [_eyes.sh_](https://github.com/naltun/eyes.sh) BASH script that scans domains and IP addresses for relevant information. It is useful for information gathering during penetration testing, and it utilizes APIs to keep your identity safe.

This program is a Golang adaptation of the _eyes.sh_ BASH script, which is a BASH adaptation of [ReconDog](https://github.com/UltimateHackers/ReconDog).

NOTE: This program is transitioning away from using RESTful APIS in favor of using a native API. This README will be updated when the transition is complete.

### Downloading and Using
From your terminal, run: `go get github.com/naltun/eyes`, and if your $GOPATH is set properly, you can simply execute `eyes` from the terminal.
